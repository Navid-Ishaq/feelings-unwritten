# 💫 “Where the Heart Never Left”  
### A Soulful Dialogue Between Longing and Presence

---

Where are you, my friend?  
I searched for you in the corners of memory —  
in the pause between sentences,  
in the silence between sighs,  
in old rooms  
and even older thoughts.

Where did you go?

Every day now carries the sound  
of your absence.  
Even joy feels quieter.  
Even sunlight feels like it’s waiting  
for something… or someone.

You say you're gone —  
but then, why does the air still carry your name?  
Why do the stars still whisper things only you knew?

"Where are you?"  
I ask again — not with my voice,  
but with my ache.

And then —  
**a hush... a heartbeat...  
a breath... a truth.**

A soft voice rises, not from outside,  
but from a warm, worn corner of my soul:

> **“My dear friend,  
> I never left.  
> I’ve been here all along —  
> sitting quietly  
> in the folds of your spirit.”**

## 🌙 Final Whisper

> _Some friends don’t walk beside you.  
> They live inside you —  
> as stillness,  
> as strength,  
> as soft memory that never says goodbye._
