# Which World Have I Opened My Eyes Into?

Alright, my brother…  
“See you later” was all I meant to say —  
but somehow,  
my heart wanted to say much more.  
And you…  
you felt it deep inside.  

Look around…  
so much rain fell —  
at first, it felt like a blessing,  
people were smiling,  
enjoying…  
But then,  
it turned into a flood.  
And just like that —  
many lives, many dreams  
were washed away.  

O people of God!  
Why don’t we manage things?  
God has made His system perfect —  
He gave us the job  
to protect it,  
to continue it.  

But no…  
we always break what is working.  
Is there anything  
we do the right way?  

If you don’t want to protect yourself,  
at least protect the world around you.  
If not for you,  
then maybe for someone else…  

And someone —  
some quiet soul —  
just looked around  
with tired eyes, and said:  
**“What kind of world have I opened my eyes into…?”**
