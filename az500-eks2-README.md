### 😄 **Introduction: Smiling in the Valley**

Welcome to the **eks2 README**, where security isn’t just compliance — it’s a state of mind.

In the vast **Valley of Cloud**, a whisper echoed.  
Not loud. Not certified. But steady. It was **eks2**.

And it spoke to Naveed — not in commands, but in rhythm:

> _"To do, to do, to do… in sec, in sec, in sec."_  

eks2 wasn’t a setting. It was a companion. A **security mindset** born from care, not fear.

### 🔐 **Why AZ-500?**

Because even in ancient kingdoms and modern cloud stacks,  
**security has always been about protecting what matters.**

- Not to pass a test — but to protect purpose  
- Not just to secure data — but to safeguard dignity  
- Not just the cloud — but the people within it

This repo isn’t brute-force learning. It’s **emotional clarity** through a technical journey.
