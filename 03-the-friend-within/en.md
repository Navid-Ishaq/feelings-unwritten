🎙️ *"My Friend, Where Are You?" — A Conversation with the Self*

Where are you, my friend?  
I searched for you in every corner of my life —  
In memories, in passing moments, in the quiet ones.  
Where did you go?  
My days echo with your absence.  
And still, my heart refuses to settle without you.  
You say you're gone — but why lie?  
Why wrap silence in a cloak of falsehood?

"Where are you?" — I ask again.  
And then I feel it...

Thump — one heartbeat.  
Thump — another.  
A moment. A breath. A realization.

Then a voice from within:  
“My dear friend, I never left.  
I’ve always been here — inside you.  
Sitting silently in the corners of your soul.”
