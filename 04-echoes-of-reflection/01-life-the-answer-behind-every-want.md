## 🌌 **Life: A Silent Answer**

### 🌱 1. A List of Wants

Imran carried an old notepad in his coat pocket.
Each page had something scribbled:
**“I want this.”**
**“At this time.”**
**“At this place.”**
**“For this reason.”**

He added something new every day.
But the peace? It felt farther with every line.

### ⏳ 2. In the Mirror of Time

One day, even with everything seemingly in place, his heart felt hollow.
A strange kind of exhaustion — like his soul had run far, but arrived nowhere.
He closed the notepad and gently asked himself:

**“What do I want?”**
**“When do I want it?”**
**“Why do I want it?”**
**“Where do I want it?”**

### 🕊️ 3. The Answer... Hidden Inside the Question

Moments passed.
No thunder. No revelation.
Just a whisper from within:

**“What you’re searching for in everything… is life itself.”**
**Not the want. Not the time. Not the reason. Not the place — just life.”**

### 🌌 4. Life — The Quiet Thread Through It All

And he began to see:

**Desires are like rivers — but life is the stillness underneath.**
**Time is the path — but life is the feeling in each step.**
**Place is the soil — but life is the sky within you.**
**Reason is the question — but life… is the answer.**

### 🌸 5. After That Day

Imran didn’t throw away the notepad.
He just turned to a blank page and wrote one line:

**“I want life — the real kind. Quiet. Whole. Present.”**

Then he stepped outside.
No rush. No destination.
Just a lightness in his chest —
And maybe for the first time… he was **alive**.

### ✨ A Gentle Question for You, Too:

**Can you feel the life beneath your list of wants?**
