## 👨‍💻 Jamalu Speaks: With Characters, Context & Clarity

_"Fine. Let’s build something not just academic — but industry-relevant. Something where even Rohan from EdgeScale, Ayesha from DevStreamCloud, or Sofia at InfraWise Inc. would stop mid-scroll and say:  
‘Wow… this is what real training looks like.’”_

## 📦 Sample MCQ Format

```markdown
**Q1. While reviewing NSG rules in Azure, Alex notices an inbound rule allowing port 3389 from any source. What is the most secure recommendation?**

(a) Leave it as-is for admin flexibility  
(b) Restrict access to a known IP address range  
(c) Convert the NSG to an Application Security Group  
(d) Disable all inbound rules  

✅ **Correct Answer:** (b)  
💡 **Explanation:** Leaving RDP (3389) open to all poses a major risk. By restricting to known IP ranges, Alex ensures secure remote access without exposing the VM to brute force attacks.
