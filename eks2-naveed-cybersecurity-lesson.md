# A Password That Crushed 158 Years – A Conversation Between Naveed and eks2

## Intro – Dear eks2, tell me…

I just finished reading a heartbreaking article on BBC.

> **A single weak password** destroyed a 158-year-old company, KNP, in the UK. The company was brought to its knees by a ransomware gang. Hundreds of workers lost their jobs, and an entire legacy vanished – all due to a guessed password.

As I sat in shock, eyes fixed on the screen, I whispered:

**"Eks2... my dear eks2... what is this? Where was the world when this happened? Why aren't there global laws strong enough to protect us? How could something so preventable not be prevented?"**

And then Mr. eks2 replied.

## The Calm Voice of eks2

**Eks2:**
> "Naveed, this isn't just the story of a company. It is a cry. A warning. A wake-up call."

> "The digital world is like a beautiful house — but with many invisible doors. The attackers are not gods; they’re just people searching for one door left unlocked. KNP had strong systems, but just one weak password — and that was enough."

## A Dialogue of Responsibility

**Naveed:**
> "So, a simple password? Just that?"

**Eks2:**
> "Yes, just that. A single door — left open. Once inside, the hackers encrypted everything. Their message was cold:  
> _'If you're reading this, your company is partially or fully dead... let's negotiate.'_  
> They wanted up to £5 million. KNP didn’t have it. The company fell."

> "And the saddest part? The employee whose password was guessed… he probably doesn’t even know he caused this."

## And Then eks2 Looked Me in the Eyes...

**Eks2:**
> "Now tell me, Naveed... isn't our responsibility even greater?"

> "We are the owners of this repo, this knowledge, this movement. And it's not enough to pass an exam. We must teach in such a way that no one — no business, no child, no elder — remains ignorant."

## The eks2 Strategy – Learn, Don’t Rush

Eks2 laid out the plan. Not a bootcamp of fear, but a **mindful path of learning**.

> "We won't teach cybersecurity like a panic drill," he said.  
> "We'll teach it like building a peaceful home:  
> Walk slowly.  
> Feel where a leak might be.  
> Patch it with care.  
> Think like an intruder — and become the protector."

## Techniques We’ll Teach Together

1. **Password Management**  
   - Use of password managers  
   - Never reuse credentials  
   - Enforce strong password policies

2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  
   - The second lock for every door  
   - Free, easy, powerful

3. **Zero Trust Approach**  
   - Trust no one by default — not even inside the network  
   - Always verify

4. **Regular Backups**  
   - Offline and offsite backups  
   - So ransomware doesn’t win even if it strikes

5. **Simulations & Real-World Thinking**  
   - Not textbook theory  
   - But real "What if someone enters my system now?" thinking

## Beyond Certifications – A Confident Mind

**Naveed:**
> "Eks2, are we doing all this just to pass AZ-500 or some cybersecurity course?"

**Eks2:**
> "No, my friend. We’re building something much stronger. We are planting confidence."

> "A mind that can ask:  
> _Can someone breach me?_  
> _How would I stop them?_  
> And answer it with a calm, patient, and prepared smile."

## The Final Word from eks2

> "Naveed, if we don’t do this now — who will? If we don’t start with the basics, who will pay the price next time?"

> "Cybersecurity isn’t just for experts. It’s for **everyone** who uses a phone, a computer, a connection."
