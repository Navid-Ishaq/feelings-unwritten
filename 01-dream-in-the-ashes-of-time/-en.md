**A Tale — A Dream Wrapped in the Ashes of Time**

One day,
I woke up —
No noise, no movement,
Just a shadow crawling along the walls...
As if time had unfolded all its secrets before me.

I looked at the world —
And my gaze paused,
Every scene felt like a long-lost moment of time.
Every face was veiled in the fog of years.

Someone asked:
**"What stage of life are you standing in?"**
I stayed silent —
Because the feeling inside me,
How could it ever turn into words?

Silence spoke,
Stillness called out,
**"What’s wrong with you?"**
I kept wrestling with myself,
But no answer came —
Only a silence that spanned a century…

Then suddenly, a voice echoed —
**"Congratulations!
You’re nearing sixty years..."**
My heart trembled —
**"Sixty?"**
But my friend, I’ve done nothing yet!

I was only beginning to gather the courage
To stand on life’s doorstep
And peer inside…

When did we ever say we were complete?
We’ve always been unfinished.
And every seemingly complete moment
Only revealed a new absence...

Yes, I’ve seen —
Many faces,
The closest of bonds,
Slip silently
Into the fog, without even a goodbye...

But my heart —
It still doesn’t accept “farewell.”
There’s still so much
Left to say,
Left to hear,
Left to set right…

This world,
These problems,
These scattered dreams —
They’re all waiting for me.

And me?
I have no intention of leaving just yet.

So,
No goodbyes,
No farewells...

Just say this much —
**Take care,
The story is still being written.**
